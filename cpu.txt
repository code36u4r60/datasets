The data in the file cpu.csv are taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The data set consists of 209 different computer configurations, as specified by the
following six explanatory variables:

• Cycle Time (MYCT, in nanoseconds),
• Min Main Memory (MMIN, in kilobytes),
• Max Main Memory (MMAX, in kilobytes),
• Cache of Main Memory (CACH, in kilobytes),
• Min Number of Channels,
• Max Number of Channels.

The published and the estimated relative CPU performances [PRP (published
relative performance) and ERP (event-related potentials)] are the two response
variables that need to be explained. Here we consider PRP as the response.
