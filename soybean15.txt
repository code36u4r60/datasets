The soybean data set is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Soybean+(Large)). The data come from the
paper by Michalski and Chilausky (1980).

The data set soybean15.csv contains 290 different diseased soybean samples.
The type of disease (there are 15 different classes of disease, such as charcoal rot,
brown stem rot, and downey mildew) is given in the first column. The next 35
columns contain categorical factors that describe various attributes of the soybean
plant and the growing conditions; a nominal scale is assumed for all attributes.

The objective is to use the information on these attributes to predict the disease
classification. Some attributes include missing values (they are labeled as blanks
in the Excel file, and as NA in the R session); 24 of the 290 cases have a missing
observation for at least one of the attributes, which leaves 266 observations for the
analysis. The list of attributes with their outcomes is shown as follows:

1. date: april,may,june,july,august,september,october.
