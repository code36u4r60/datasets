The HousePrices.csv data set includes prices and characteristics of
n = 128 houses in a major US metropolitan area. The variables include Price
(sale price in dollars), SqFt (size in square feet), Bedrooms (number of),
Bathrooms (number of), Offers (number of offers the house has received
while on the market), Brick (whether it is brick construction; Yes/No), and
Neighborhood (East/North/West). 

The objective is to explain the sale price of a house as a function of 
its characteristics.
