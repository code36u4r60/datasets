TheLoanData.csv data set lists the outcome of n = 5611 loans. This
data set comes from the consumer-to-consumer (C2C) lending market where
borrowers post loan listings and lenders invest in those loans by bidding
on the borrower’s loan rates. The data variables include the Status of the
loan (ultimate outcome; whether the loan is current, late, or in default), the
Credit.Grade of the loan (categorical; from the best rating AA to the worst
one, HC for heavy risk), Amount of loan (in dollars), Age of loan (in months),
the Borrower.Rate, and the Debt.To.Income.Ratio. Here the objective is to
distinguish among good and bad loans, that is, to classify loans into good
(current), late, and default loans.
