The data in the file wine.csv (taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository) are
the results of a chemical analysis of 174 Italian wines from three known cultivars
(a cultivar is a group of grapes selected for desirable characteristics that can be
maintained by propagation). The chemical analysis determined the quantities of the
following 13 different constituents:

• Alcohol
• Malic acid
• Ash
• Alkalinity of ash
• Magnesium
• Total phenols
• Flavanoids
• Nonflavanoid phenols
• Proanthocyanins
• Color intensity
• Hue
• OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
• Proline.

The objective is to classify the 174 wines on the basis of their attributes and
to predict their cultivar.
