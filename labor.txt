This is a data set that relates the outcome of labor negotiations (good or bad, as
seen by the workers who are covered by these agreements) to attributes of the
negotiated contract. The data in file labor.csv is available from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository. It includes 57 Canadian contracts, 16 attributes, and an overall
outcome (0/1) variable. The data set contains many missing variables. For the
construction of the classification tree, we have omitted variables with many missing
values, and we concentrate our analysis on the following four attributes: duration
of the contract, wage increase in the first year of the contract, the number of
weekly hours negotiated for, and the quality of the vacation benefit package (categorical
on a nominal scale). 

The objective is to predict the overall quality of the contract.
