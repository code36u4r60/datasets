The weather.csv data set contains 1 year of daily observations
from a single weather station (Canberra); n = 366 rows. The weatherAUS.csv data
set contains n = 36, 881 daily observations from 45 Australian weather stations.
The weather data were obtained from the Australian Commonwealth Bureau of
Meteorology. The data has been processed to provide a binary target variable
RainTomorrow (whether there is rain during the next day; No/Yes) and a continuous
target (risk) variable RISK_MM (the amount of rain recorded during the next day).
The data set includes the following variables:

Date: The date of observation (a date object).
Location: The common name of the location of the weather station.
MinTemp: The minimum temperature in degrees centigrade.
MaxTemp: The maximum temperature in degrees centigrade.
Rainfall: The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in millimeters.
Evaporation: Class A pan evaporation (in millimeters) during 24 h (until 9 a.m.).
Sunshine: The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day.
WindGustDir: The direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 h to midnight.
WindGustSpeed: The speed (in kilometers per hour) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 h to midnight.
WindDir9am: The direction of the wind gust at 9 a.m.
WindDir3pm: The direction of the wind gust at 3 p.m.
WindSpeed9am: Wind speed (in kilometers per hour) averaged over 10 min before 9 a.m.
WindSpeed3pm: Wind speed (in kilometers per hour) averaged over 10 min before 3 p.m.
RelHumid9am: Relative humidity (in percent) at 9 am.
RelHumid3pm: Relative humidity (in percent) at 3 p.m.
Pressure9am: Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 9 a.m.
Pressure3pm: Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3 p.m.
Cloud9am: Fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 9 a.m. This is measured in ”oktas,” which are a unit of eighths. It records how many eighths of the sky are obscured by cloud. A 0 measure indicates completely clear sky, while an 8 indicates that it is completely overcast.
Cloud3pm: Fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 3 p.m; see Cloud9am for a description of the values.
Temp9am: Temperature (degrees C) at 9 a.m.
Temp3pm: Temperature (degrees C) at 3 p.m.
RainToday: Integer 1 if precipitation (in millimeters) in the 24 h to 9 a.m. exceeds 1 mm, otherwise 0.
RISK_MM: The continuous target variable; the amount of rain recorded during the next day.
RainTomorrow: The binary target variable whether it rains or not during the next day.

Objectives: Analyze the data sets. The objective is to predict tomorrow’s rain amount (a continuous target variable) and tomorrow’s likelihood of rain (a binary target variable).
