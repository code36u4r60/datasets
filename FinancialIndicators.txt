The FinancialIndicators.csv data set lists indicators of the financial
health of n = 7112 companies listed at various stock exchanges. The objective
here is to explore the relevance of accounting information for explaining
and predicting stock returns. Financial indicators include profitability ratios
(such as gross margins and profit margins), liquidity ratios (such as the operating
cost flow ratio), activity ratios (such as the stock turnover ratio), and
debt and market ratios. Analyzing this data set, one appreciates the fact that
(i) available financial indicators are closely related (multicollinear) and (ii) it
is not particularly easy to obtain strong relationships between stock price (or
stock price changes) and the accounting information.
