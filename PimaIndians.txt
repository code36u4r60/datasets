The data in the file PimaIndians.csv are taken from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository. The data set consists of 768 females at least 21 years old and of
Pima Indian heritage. The response variable is the absence/presence of diabetes
(coded 0/1, in the variable Class). The objective is to predict the presence of
diabetes from the following eight continuous risk factors:

• Number of pregnancies
• Plasma glucose concentration determined by an oral glucose tolerance test
• Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
• Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
• 2-h serum insulin
• Body mass index [weight in kilograms/(height in meters)2]
• Diabetes pedigree function
• Age (years)

Several techniques can be used for the purpose of classifying Pima Indians into
the diabetes/no diabetes groups, including logistic regression, classification trees,
and linear or quadratic discriminant functions.
