This is a small data set for assessing the riskiness of certain loans. The riskiness
of a loan (low, moderate, and high) in the last column of the data file credit.csv
is determined from four categorical risk predictors with the following attribute categories:

• Credit history (bad, good, unknown)
• Debt (high, low)
• Collateral (adequate, none)
• Income group (>35, 0–15, 15–35)

Note that a complete factorial arrangement includes (3)(2)(2)(3) = 36 attribute
combinations; this data set includes only 14.
